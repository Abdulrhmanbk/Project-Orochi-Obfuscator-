# Project Orochi
.NET Obfuscator which contains bugs and context support. Name gotten from a ship on the anime "Azur Lane".

# About Name
Orochi ship is made by Sakura Empire faction. Not gonna lie, I am not an Sakura Empire fan but this is the only name I could get from the anime.

# About Bugs etc.
Yeah, there is some bugs in Orochi. You could fix them yourself. Feel free to send a pull request when you fix them.

# Goals
Adding a some type custom jit.

# Building
If you gives errors in first-time building, do not care it. Try to build again. It should build succesfully. Do not forget to add dnlib reference to all projects.

# Suspicious Mutations Protection
Yes, It is some kind of suspect. I know some people from Reverse X will swear me and try to threat/treat me.
By the way, this is not the reason why I disabled my discord account.

# Thanks to:
