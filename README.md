# About Name
Orochi ship is made by Sakura Empire faction. Not gonna lie, I am not an Sakura Empire fan but this is the only name I could get from the anime.

# About Bugs etc.
Yeah, there is some bugs in Orochi. You could fix them yourself. Feel free to send a pull request when you fix them.

# Goals
Adding a some type of jit protection.

# Building
If it gives errors in first-time building, do not mind it. Try to build again. It should build successfully. Do not forget to add dnlib reference to all projects

# Thanks to:
